Linear Analysis includes analysis of a structure, within the elastic limit. It includes only small deformation and no information or results for failure of the structure. Non-linear analysis is the analysis of structure which includes large displacements or permanent deformation, instabilities and even the failures of structure. Non-linear analysis is preferred over the linear analysis as the complete data of a structure is achieved and this can be relied on. Most of the softwares nowadays solve the structural problems using Non-linear analysis approch. 


## ATENA 

Advanced Tool for Engineering Nonlinear Analysis is a Non-linear analysis software. Features of ATENA are as follows:
•	It offers unique visualization of crack propagation.
•	It can display real-time results even during the nonlinear analysis.
•	It is based on finite element method and fracture mechanics.
•	It has advanced material models for concrete, reinforcement, steel and masnory.
